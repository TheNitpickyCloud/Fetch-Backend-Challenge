## Getting Started

Note: You need to have node installed for the setup to work. This setup is guaranteed to work with node v20.5.0 and npm v9.8.1.

To run the development server, download the repository and navigate to the root directory in a terminal (the directory is named Fetch-Backend-Challenge if you haven't changed the name) and run the following commands:

```
npm ci
```
after every dependency is installed successfully, run
```
npm run devStart
```
to run the tests, keep the server running and in a different terminal (in the same root folder) run
```
npm run test
```

You can make queries to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
